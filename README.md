# Karan's Java DSA Repository

Welcome to my **Java DSA** repository!  
I am **Karan**, and I am on a journey to master **Java** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**. This repository is a reflection of my learning process, where I upload the problems I solve and the concepts I learn step by step. I am constantly updating this repo as I complete new DSA topics.

## About Me

Hi, I'm **Karan**! I am passionate about programming and problem-solving. This repository represents my efforts to improve my skills in **Java** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**. I am learning DSA step by step and solving problems along the way, one topic at a time. My goal is to understand each concept deeply and to build a solid foundation in both **Java** and **DSA**.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The main programming language I use for solving DSA problems.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
  
## Learning Approach

I am following a structured approach to learn **DSA** and mastering it with **Java**. The approach I follow is simple — I complete one topic at a time, and for each topic, I:
- Study the theory behind the concept.
- Solve multiple problems related to that topic.
- Upload my solutions and progress here.

As I move forward, I will update this file and reflect on the concepts I have learned. This makes it easier to maintain the repository and track my progress.

### How to track my progress

- After finishing a topic (e.g., Arrays), I will add a **progress update** in this file.
- I will link to the corresponding folder where the solutions for that topic are stored.
- Each time I finish solving problems related to that topic, I will mark it as **completed**.

### Current Progress

- **Arrays** - ✅ Completed
  - Basics of Arrays, Array Manipulation, Two Pointer Technique, Searching and Sorting in Arrays.
  - Folder: [Arrays](./Arrays)
- **Linked Lists** - ⏳ In Progress
  - Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List.

Each topic will be updated with similar structure as I progress further. You can always check the folders corresponding to each topic for solutions.
